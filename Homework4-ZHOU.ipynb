    "1. Consider the problem of classifying a binary response variable (i.e., $y \\in \\{1,0\\}$). If there is no overlap in the values of X when y = 1 and when y=0,  such that there is a large “gap” between the two distributions of X values, then this is problematic for one of the classifiers discussed in class and the text. What classifier does this situation pose a problem for? Explain conceptually why this is a problem and compare it with another classifier approach that does not suffer this limitation."

    "This situation pose a problem for the LDA classifier, because this scenario breaks the assumption of LDA that the two distribution have equal variance. QDA is more appropriate in this situation because it assumes different variance for the two distributions."

    "For logistic regression approaches, it uses logistic function to model the conditional probability $Pro(Y=k|X=x)$ and uses the method of maximum likelihood to estimate parameters.\n",

    "For LDA approach, it uses Bayes' theorem to model the conditional probability $Pro(Y=k|X=x)$ and uses the estimated mean and variance from a normal distribution to estimate parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For kNN approach,it identifies K training observations that are closest to x, and then assign x to the class to which the plurality of these observation belong. The choice of K affects the flexibility/bias tradoff: As K increase, the method becomes less flexible and we need to find the best K which minimizes the test error and accounts for much variance.\n"

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that adding more features during classification, which decrease the test errors at the begining, will degrade the performance of classifier at certain point. This is problematic for kNN classification because kNN is a non-parametric classification approach; in high dimensional contexts, the K is not optimal and probably can explain much variance in the training data at the cost of high test errors.

    "4. Suppose that we take a data set, divide it into equally-sized training and test sets, and then try out two different classification procedures. First we use logistic regression and get an error rate of 20% on the training data and 30% on the test data. Next we use 1-nearest neighbors (i.e. K = 1) and get an average error rate (averaged over both test and training data sets) of 18%. Based on these results, which method should we prefer to use for classification of new observations? Why?"
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "Logistic regression is preferred. For KNN with K=1, the training error rate is 0% because for any training observation, its nearest neighbor will be the response itself. So, that means that KNN has a test error rate of 36%. Thus logistic regression is preferred because of its lower test error rate of only 30%."
